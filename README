This program contains the implementation of a number of algorithms that match strings against
Regular Expressions and deliver the parse trees.
It contains also the generation of a corpus of REs and texts to parse, and the benchmarking
of the implemented algorithms.

Generation

    The program has been developed with Oracle jdk 1.8, and the Microsoft visual c++:

    javah -jni Re
        -- this produces a number of include (.h files)
    c:\"Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin\vcvars32"
        -- this sets a number of environment variables
    cl /I"c:\Program Files\java\jdk1.8.0\include" /I"c:\Program Files\java\jdk1.8.0\include\win32" /LD re.cpp /Fere.dll
        -- this produces the native library (re.dll)
    javac -encoding UTF8  -cp ..\..;. Re.java

Installation

    There is no need to install it, the program can be run directly from a command prompt.

Run

    - generate the corpus of REs and texts (strings)
      - delete the file samplesN.ser, where N is SNUMBER (see below)
      - run: java -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -Xmx1200m -Xss10m  -cp .;..\.. Re 2>tmp

    - run the benchmark
      - delete the files measure100N.ser, measure1000N.ser, measureCompN.ser, measureMemN.ser,
        where N is WNUMBER (see below)
      - make sure that the computer has as few programs running as possible
      - run start /b /wait /affinity 0x1 java -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -Xmx1200m -Xss10m  -cp .;..\.. Re 2>tmp

    - display the results:
      - with Firefox or Chrome open rechartmeaN.html (where N is WNUMBER)
      - a file rechartmeaN.tex is also produced: it contains the charts for the paper

    N.B. the constants SNUMBER and WNUMBER allow to make several samples and measurements
    without a need to delete or rename the existing ones.
    start /affinity runs this program binding it to a core, and a drawback is that no
    other activity can be done on the computer until the test terminates, and also that to
    interrump it, the command propmt shell must be terminated.
    The normal run on the other hand runs the program normally, and it is thus handier
    when no times are measured.

    For convenience, the samples measurements and chart files have been included.
